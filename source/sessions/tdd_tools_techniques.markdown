## Getting Started

### Clone the Repo

We have set up a [Rails
Project](https://github.com/harlow/railsconf_intro_track) with RSpec and
Capybara set up. These will be the core requirements for the workshop. 

Please clone the repository and make sure you can run `rspec` from the root of
the project:

{% terminal %}
$ git clone git@github.com:harlow/railsconf_intro_track.git
$ cd railsconf_intro_track
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rspec
{% endterminal %}
